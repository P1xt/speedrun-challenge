## Details

* Fork this repository
* Pick which speedrun you want to run, add it to this README's Progress chart
* Make note of your start date, and an end date one month later
* Start coding

### The goal

Complete as many projects as you can in one month.
### Speedrun options

* [FreeCodeCamp Speedrun](./FCC_Speedrun.md)
* [Game Development Speedrun](./GameDev_Speedrun.md)
* [Frontend Speedrun](./Frontend_Speedrun.md)
* [Angular Frontend Speedrun](./Angular_Frontend_Speedrun.md)
* [Vue Frontend Speedrun](./Vue_Frontend_Speedrun.md)
* [React Frontend Speedrun](./React_Frontend_Speedrun.md)
* [Full Stack Speedrun](./FullStack_Speedrun.md)
* [Open Source PR Speedrun](./Open_Source_Speedrun.md)
* [Algorithms Speedrun](./Algorithms_Speedrun.md)


### The Rules

* You may reuse code you previously wrote, but try to improve on your prior effort in some way.
* You may ask for help and help others - preference should always be given to helping someone understand, not handing them code they don't.
* If someone is stuck, you may pair with them to help them get unstuck.
* If someone pairs with you to help you get unstuck, be sure to make a note to credit them in your repo and in your blog posts.

### Deliverables

* as many projects as you can complete in one month
* For each project, you must write a blog post.
* For each project, you must link to your code in a git repository.
* For each "web based" project, you must link to a running demo that's accessible on the web. (Not necessary for projects without a web component, such as pull requests, algorithms, or mobile or desktop apps.)
* You may combine multiple projects into one git repository.

### The Competition

How many projects can you complete in one month?

**Note:** This is the type of competition where, yes, winning is awesome, but participating and giving it your all is the best prize, and everyone can get that :D

### One week "pre-speedrun" prep

* Regardless which speedrun you pick, you're going to want to know how to create a git repository, and save your code to it - you can use Github, Gitlab or Bitbucket, they all work the same. Get git setup on your PC before you start the speedrun.
* You will want an editor that you are familiar with setup on your PC. If you already have that, good. If you don't, I recommend Visual Studio Code.
* If you're doing a FCC or Frontend Speedrun and need some HTML/CSS practice, I'd recommend [Shay Howe](https://learn.shayhowe.com/).
* If you're doing an Angular, React or Vue Speedrun, I recommend looking at their official docs and following the beginner guides, build the demo app.
* If you're doing a Game Development Speedrun, I recommend installing and configuring your engine of choice, working through their intro guide, and becoming familiar with their docs.
* If you're doing an Algorithms Speedrun, I recommend doing a quick readthrough of the docs for whatever language you'll be using, and a skim through [Open Data Structures](http://opendatastructures.org/).

### HTML / CSS prep for Frontend or CSS challenge
